tiny_description: Learn to use the two basic functions in the Debug module.
---

Basic debugging in Elm uses two methods. `Debug.log` and `Debug.crash`. Use `log` to print to the web console, and `crash` when you want to halt execution of your app. Usage of either method should be removed before deploying your code to production.

### Samples

{% highlight elm linenos %}
Array.toList (Debug.log "shuffled" (shuffle fullDeck 0 seed))

case Array.get i deck of
  Nothing -> Debug.crash "index out of bounds"
  Just c -> c
{% endhighlight %}
