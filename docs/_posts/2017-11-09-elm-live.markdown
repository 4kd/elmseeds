[Elm-Live](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live) provides automatic compliation, a web server, and live reloading in a convenient package.

If you already use Elm and want to recommend an easy path for others to get started, look no further than Elm-Live.

### Examples

```sh
$ npm install -g elm-live
$ elm-live src/Main.elm --output=elm.js --pushstate
```
